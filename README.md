# Restaurant-MicrosoftBot
seeks to build a chatbot using Microsoft Bot Builder. This is fast becoming a popular tool for building bots and can be used to design an efficient conversation manager, rather than building it from scratch, as we did previously. We will build a chatbot to search for restaurants using a data service called Zomato. This will then be exposed on the Skype  channel.
